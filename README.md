# üèß **Bank Account Master** üèß

## üíπ **Project Description**
The application helps bank customers manage their bank account and transactions effectively. It allows bank clients to manage their account balance, perform transactions, and obtain a printed bank statement with relevant details.

## ‚úÖ **Features**
- Record deposits and withdrawals with specific dates.
- Print bank statements showing transaction history, credits, debits, and balances.
- Credited values are in GREEN and debited values are in RED.
- Balance values are in GREEN if positive and RED if negative.

    For example,
  
    **Given** a client makes a deposit of 1000 on 10-01-2012  
    **And** a deposit of 2000 on 13-01-2012  
    **And** a withdrawal of 500 on 14-01-2012  
    **When** she prints her bank statement  
    **Then** she would see

## üíª **How the application was created**

1.  The APP was developed using an **Object-Oriented Design** approach. I tried to follow the **SOLID Principles** for the design and organization of classes. Following are the user stories and domain models.

### **User Stories**
```
1. As a bank client, I want to add an initial balance to my account, so that I can add or withdraw money from the account balance.
2. As a bank client, I want to make deposits on a specific date so that I can increase my account balance.
3. As a bank client, I want to make withdrawals on a specific date so that I can decrease my account balance.
4. As a bank client, I want to retrieve my current account balance and transaction, so I can keep track of the transactions.
5. As a bank client, I want to print my bank statement with title `date       || credit  || debit  || balance`.
6. As a bank client, I want my bank statement for each transaction in reverse chronological order, so I can have a complete review on my transaction history.
7. As a bank client, I want the credited values to be displayed in green and debited values in red, so I can identify them easily.
8. As a bank client, I want the balance to be displayed in green if positive and red if negative, so I can identify them easily.
```
### **Domain Models**
The application is structured using the following domain models:
| **Object**       | **Properties**                      | **Messages**                                                  | **Output**                                |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Balance          | initialBalance (default value: 0)   | Constructor: Balance(initialBalance)                          |                                           |
|                  |                                     | add(amountToAdd)                                              | balance @number                           |
|                  |                                     | withdraw(amountToWithdraw)                                    | balance @number                           |
|                  |                                     | getBalance()                                                  | balance @number                           |
| Transaction      | date, depositAmount, withdrawAmount | Constructor: Transaction(date, depositAmount, withdrawAmount) |                                           |
|                  |                                     | getDate()                                                     | date @Date                                |
|                  |                                     | getDepositAmount()                                            | amount @number                            |
|                  |                                     | getWithdrawAmount()                                           | amount @number                            |
| Account          | balance, transactions               | Constructor: Account(balance)                                 |                                           |
|                  |                                     | credit(transaction)                                           |                                           |
|                  |                                     | debit(transaction)                                            |                                           |
|                  |                                     | getBalance()                                                  | balance @number                           |
|                  |                                     | getTransactions()                                             | txnHistory @Array                         |
| StatementPrinter |                                     | printStatement(transactions)                                  | formatted statement as required           |

2. I used **encapsulation** to (1) encapsulate adding and storing Transactions in a Balance class; (2) encapsulate Statement formatting in a StatementPrinter class; (3) encapsulate Transaction data in a Transaction class; (4) encapsulate account management in an Account class.

3. I practiced **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** by (1) writing unit tests to verify the behavior of individual classes and components are performed as expected and commit to GitHub; (2) writing production code and refactoring code iteratively and commit to GitHub.
